Clustering
To provide with hands-on experience in implementing clustering techniques on real-world datasets. The paper "Urban Spatial Order: Street Network Orientation, Configuration, and Entropy" by Geoff Boeing examines street network patterns across 100 global cities. It utilizes OpenStreetMap data and OSMnx software to analyze street orientations and configurations. The study focuses on the entropy of street bearings and other metrics like average street segment length, circuity, node degree, and proportions of intersections and dead-ends. It also introduces a new measure, orientation-order, to quantify a city's grid-like structure. Statistical relationships between street orientation-order and other spatial order indicators are explored, revealing distinctive patterns in different regions, particularly between U.S./Canadian and other cities. The research provides insights into urban design and planning, highlighting the complexity and patterns of urban transportation systems worldwide. 

Keyword Co-occurence
This project aims to utilize the comprehensive Web of Science (WoS) database to search for publications related to generative AI. Through an analytical approach focused on keyword co-occurrence networks derived from author keywords, we will map the intellectual structure and identify the core themes and trends in generative AI research. 
The tasks include:
1.Comprehensive Literature Retrieval: Leverage the Web of Science database to systematically search for and retrieve publications related to generative AI. This will involve defining a set of search terms that effectively capture the scope of generative AI, including but not limited to terms like "generative adversarial networks", “generative AI”
2. Keyword Co-Occurrence Network Analysis: Build a keyword co-occurrence network from the author keywords associated with the retrieved publications. This network will visually represent how different research themes
in generative AI are interconnected, highlighting the most frequently mentioned and central keywords.
3. Identification of Key Research Themes: Analyze the keyword co-occurrence network using the weighted network analysis. This will help in understanding the focus areas of current research and predicting. future trends

Permutation entropy
The primary objective is to create a user-friendly and reliable tool that can accurately identify patterns associated with heavy alcohol consumption based on motion data captured by smartphones. This app will utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze accelerometer readings and detect anomalies indicative of excessive drinking behavior. Additionally, the app will prioritize user privacy and data security, ensuring that sensitive information is handled with utmost confidentiality. The ultimate goal is to provide individuals with valuable insights into their drinking habits, promote responsible alcohol consumption,
and potentially facilitate early intervention measures for those at risk of alcohol-related harm.
